// `daily_check_ins` other than how many rows exist. Verifying the baseline must
// never become a way to read protected health data, so the check counts the
// check-in table and never looks inside it.
//
// `parseBaselineRow` and `compareBaseline` are pure so the leak-shape can be
// tested without a database.
